# Portfolio
This project exhibits the inner workings of my portfolio website, showcasing my html and css skills. I am super excited to feature my future projects within this portfolio, including the CRM project that really inspired my love for programming. I love that as a programmer we can truly create anything. We are truly our own wizards. This portfolio is the perfect medium to express myself creatively and share my story. I wanted to convey a sense of professionalism with a bit of a whimsical touch. I really love paying attention to the smallest of details as it conveys how much effort and fun one can have with programming. I knew I wanted something eye-catching, a sprinkle of light and dark. I love futuristic dystopian themes so initially I was thinking neon blue, maybe even purple for that cyberpunk look. As I continued to code along, I faced many roadblocks that made me a bit disheartened. In the midst of my dispirit, I found hope. Once I found the answer to the problems that drove me into a frenzy, it was as if I was solving a puzzle and unlocking something deeper within my spirit. Programming for me is healing. My portfolio symbolizes that in the darkest times, hope is something you give yourself; in the midst of darkness, light persists. It is often in the darkness skies that we see the brightest stars. Never forget that the sun shines from within you.
