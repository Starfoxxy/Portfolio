            <p>Hello!<br><br>I'm Athena Jacob, a driven full-stack developer committed to changing the world through technology.<br><br>I specialize in technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, and Node.js.<br><br>From a young age, I’ve been captivated by the ever-evolving fields of robotics and programming, with a firm belief that we can harness these technologies to solve some of the most pressing challenges facing our society. My goal is to not only build software, but to use it as a tool for transformation. I believe technology should be used to empower the vulnerable and to give people access to the information they need, when they need it.<br><br>Whether it’s providing vulnerable communities with a secure platform to voice their experiences, supporting victims of violence in sharing their stories in a safe space, tracking abuses within the system, or creating platforms that educate the youth, I am determined to be part of the change. Technology has the power to amplify these voices, giving individuals the power to share their stories, access support, and empower individuals to reclaim their lives.<br><br>Let’s change the world together, one line of code at a time.</p>

                <h3>E-Commerce Website</h3>

                <p>This E-Commerce Website showcases my ability to build a full-stack platform where users can browse products, add them to their cart, and complete the checkout process. The website features product filtering, sorting, and secure checkout with a mock payment system. User authentication ensures personalized experiences, while admin functionality allows for managing products and tracking orders. Built with React for a dynamic user interface and Node.js with MongoDB for back-end operations, this project highlights my proficiency in front-end development, CRUD operations, and full-stack integration.</p>

                <h3>Digital Marketing Performance Dashboard</h3>
